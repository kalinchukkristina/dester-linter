# dexter-linter
A repository for my individual project where I create a linter for LaTeX files.

The command is run as a command-line tool: "dexter-linter filename".\
Arguments:\
filename - path to the file you want to execute the linter on.

Options:\
--comment=int - passes how many spaces should be inserted after a comment sign;\
--newline=bool - if False is passed the new line will not be inserted after a sentence;
